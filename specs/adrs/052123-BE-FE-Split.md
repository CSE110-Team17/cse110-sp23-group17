# What is the decision?

- We choose to split our team into 2 subteams which is Backend and Frontend. Frontend will have 5 people under the lead of Mick while backend will have 3 people under the lead of Jenny. 
- We decide the the assignment of each member by asking for their own preference and also evaluate their technical experience. We first give everyone a chance to choose what they want and adjust the team accordingly to make sure that each team is balance. 
- Each co-lead will be in charge of one sub team and have the responsiblity to keep the communication between teams up to date and make sure no one fall behind. 
- We will divde the work by features. For example, for the feature display the card on result page, the frontend team will have to write the html and css code to display a blank card name and image on the website in both desktop and mobile version. The backend will work on actually display with the data form json file. 

# Why choose to split backend and frontend?

## Easier to manage 
- By spliting the team into 2 subteams, it will be easiler for the co-lead to manage the workloads and also take care of the team members as it will be easier to assigned work and communicat in smaller time. Hence we have a co-lead in each subteam, who will make sure everyone track and it will be easier to check in if your team is smaller. 
- It is also ideal because it will be eaiser to set up a common meeting time for subteam compare to the big tema.

## People get to work on what they like
- As described, each team members will have a chance to share their prefered position and we will assign them accordingly. Spliting into 2 team will also give the members to work on something that they are interested in or have more experience in. 

## Less merge conflict 
- Having 2 teams also mean that the branches in github will also split as the task is distributed based on the team. This will save us a lot of time since there will be less merge conflict as everything is mostly resolved inside the subteam in a smaller scope and there won't be much conflict in the final merge since frontend and backend work on different file. 
- Main branch is also protected this way because the change are mostly local on the front end or back end branch. Anything change to those branches will not affect the main branch.

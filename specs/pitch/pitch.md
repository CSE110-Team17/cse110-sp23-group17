# Tarot the Game
## CSS Crusaders (Team 17)

### **Statement of Purpose**
The problem our team is trying to solve is the lack of user experience when playing Tarot cards online.
After using numerous online Tarot apps, we noticed that they are all too similar to each other. They don’t interact with the user and simply prompts the user to select some number of cards. We found the process to lack engagement.

CSS Crusader’s solution is to create a tarot fortune telling web application that engages user through a game-like experience.

	Our goal is to develop a Tarot web application that makes the process of receiving a fortune more fun and interesting. By doing so, we believe that we can target a larger audience and introduce people to Tarot cards!

### **Risks and Rabbit Holes**
- One risk to watch out for is getting too caught up in trying to make a game too complex, which could lead to not finishing a usable app in time
- Another rabbit hole to avoid is adding AI features (or other features) without considering their practicality and feasibility, which could waste a lot of time and resources
- Last but not least, another potential risk is focusing too much visual effects and animations and spending too much time on them
